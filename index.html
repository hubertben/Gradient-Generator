  <h2>What is going on?</h2>
  <p>This is an implementation of Neural Networks ability to generate random gradients. The way this algorithm works is
    that every pixel of the screen is chosen as the inputs for the Neural Network and the Net recives each respective X
    and Y. The X and Y Values are scaled as to not produce extraneous color results. The Neural Net does a pass on the
    inputs through a series of layers (editable in code), and the ouput is given as a 3 dimensional vector. Each of the
    vector dimensions are inputed into an RGB color formatter, and drawn to the screen at its inital X and Y location.
